# AirCnC-FrontEnd

This is the front-end of a web application made in a bootcamp called OmniStack, by RocketSeat. 

The idea is to make an allusion to Airbnb, but instead of Bed and Breakfast, is Code and Coffe, is an application where people can sign their spots and make possible for users to rent their spaces for coding and interacting with the company members.

This is the front end of the web version of the app made with React.
